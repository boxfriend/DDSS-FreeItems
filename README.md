# Free Items
#### A Mod for Dale & Dawson Stationery Supplies
## This is already deprecated
In a recent update the devs switched to IL2CPP instead of Mono which they had been using. I have no experience with modding IL2CPP games so I don't think this will work and I'm not (yet) sure how to make it work.

## Info
I made this mod because I didn't want to grind a whole bunch just for a few silly cosmetic items. So now we have access to them for free.

## How to install:
1. Install [BepinEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) if not already installed
	- create a folder called `plugins` inside of the BepinEx folder in the game directory if one does not already exist
2. Download the latest `FreeItems.dll` from the [Releases](https://github.com/boxfriend/DDSS-FreeItems/releases)
3. Place `FreeItems.dll` in the `plugins` folder you made in previous step
4. Launch game and enjoy access to the now-free customizations
